# Stocks Analysis
Module 2 Challenge: Stock Analysis

### Overview of Project
Steve is looking to analyze the entire stock market over the last few years to help him provide the best, data-backed, recommendations to his parents for investing their money in stocks. We've developed a macro that allows him to complete this analysis in a matter of seconds at the click of a button.

### Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script


### Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- Refactoring code allows us to iterate on already existing code. We can make it faster, less complicated, and easier to maintain for future users. It can also be helpful to start from a shell of code rather than starting from scratch.
- Unfortunately, refactoring code can prove to be more difficult than starting from scratch if the inital code isn't a perfect fit for the data set. Taking the time to understand the existing code & tweaking it for our needs could be better spent just writing a brand new script that's customized to our needs.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
